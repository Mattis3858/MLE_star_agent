=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: Feature Engineering
Strategy:  Add a log-transform of the target variable (Sales) to better handle its skewed distribution and improve model sensitivity to relative errors, which is particularly important for MAPE optimization.
Citation:  Google ML Sales Forecasting Agent (arxiv:2506.15692) highlights log-transformation as a key preprocessing step for right-skewed sales data to normalize the target distribution and improve model performance on relative error metrics like MAPE.
Reasoning: The current pipeline has achieved a stable but stagnant MAPE around 9.3%. Sales data typically follows a right-skewed distribution where log-transformation can help the model better capture relative patterns rather than absolute differences. This is especially beneficial for MAPE, which measures relative error. The consecutive successful runs indicate the basic pipeline is working, but we need to address fundamental data characteristics to break through the performance plateau.
