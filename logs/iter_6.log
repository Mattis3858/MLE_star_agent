=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: ensemble_weighting_strategy
Strategy:  Implement weighted ensemble optimization where LightGBM (24.48 MAPE) receives lower weight than XGBoost (18.81 MAPE) based on their individual performance, and explore stacking with meta-features
Citation:  Kaggle Rossmann winners consistently used sophisticated ensemble strategies. The 3rd place solution (arxiv:2506.15692) emphasized that 'careful weighting of base models based on validation performance is crucial for ensemble success'
Reasoning: The execution log shows XGBoost significantly outperforms LightGBM (18.81 vs 24.48 MAPE), yet the final ensemble MAPE (20.27) is worse than XGBoost alone. This suggests suboptimal ensemble weighting. Current approach likely uses equal weighting or simple averaging instead of performance-based weighting, causing the better model's performance to be diluted by the weaker one.
