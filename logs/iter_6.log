=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: Feature Engineering
Strategy:  Add comprehensive calendar-based features including public holidays, school holidays, and promotional events, and implement a log-transform of the target variable (Sales) to handle its skewed distribution.
Citation:  Kaggle Rossmann winner solutions emphasized the importance of extensive feature engineering, particularly around calendar events and promotions. The 3rd place solution by Timo Szegedy noted that 'the most important features were the ones related to the date' (Kaggle Rossmann Competition Summary).
Reasoning: The current pipeline achieved a MAPE of ~9.79% with basic preprocessing. Given that this is the first successful iteration, the feature set is likely minimal. Rossmann sales are highly influenced by calendar events, store promotions, and school holidays. The sales distribution is typically right-skewed; a log-transform can make the target more Gaussian-like, improving model performance. This approach aligns with proven strategies from the competition where top performers created rich temporal features.
