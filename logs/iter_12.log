=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: Feature Engineering
Strategy:  Add comprehensive calendar-based features including public holiday flags, school holiday indicators, and promotional event sequences, and apply a log-transform to the target variable (Sales) to handle its right-skewed distribution.
Citation:  Google ML Sales Forecasting Agent (arxiv:2506.15692) emphasizes the importance of rich temporal features and target transformations for retail sales forecasting. The winning solution of the Rossmann Kaggle competition extensively used calendar features and log-transformed sales.
Reasoning: The current pipeline is producing stable but non-improving results (6 consecutive non-improving rounds after Iter 6). The execution log shows the model is training successfully but hitting early stopping at iteration 128, suggesting the current feature set may be insufficient for further learning. Retail sales are highly influenced by calendar events and typically follow a skewed distribution. Adding holiday flags, school holiday indicators, and promotional sequences can capture important temporal patterns, while a log-transform helps normalize the target variable, making it easier for the model to learn patterns across different sales magnitudes.
