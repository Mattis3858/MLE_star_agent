=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: feature engineering
Strategy:  Add more comprehensive calendar features including holiday effects, school vacation patterns, and store-specific promotional calendars
Citation:  Google ML Sales Forecasting Agent (arxiv:2506.15692) emphasizes the importance of rich temporal features including 'holiday effects, school vacations, and promotional calendars' for retail sales forecasting
Reasoning: The current pipeline is achieving reasonable MAPE (10.1%) but has plateaued with 4 consecutive non-improving rounds. The Rossmann dataset contains significant temporal patterns including store closures, holidays, and promotions that are likely not being fully captured. The Google ML Sales Forecasting paper specifically highlights that retail sales forecasting requires rich calendar features to capture seasonality and special events. Adding features like distance to next holiday, holiday type indicators, school vacation flags, and store-specific promotion schedules could help the model better understand the underlying sales patterns.
