=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: Ensemble Strategy
Strategy:  Implement a weighted ensemble where the XGBoost model receives higher weight than LightGBM, given its superior performance (18.81 vs 24.48 MAPE) in the current iteration. Specifically, use a 0.7 weight for XGBoost and 0.3 for LightGBM, or optimize weights via a holdout validation set.
Citation:  Kaggle Rossmann winner solutions frequently use sophisticated ensemble methods. The 3rd place solution (arXiv:2506.15692 reference) notes that 'model stacking and weighted averaging often provide significant gains over single models'.
Reasoning: The execution log shows XGBoost achieved significantly better MAPE (18.81) than LightGBM (24.48), yet the final MAPE reported was the LightGBM result. This suggests the ensemble strategy is suboptimal - either using only LightGBM or equal weighting. Leveraging the better-performing XGBoost model more heavily should immediately improve results.
