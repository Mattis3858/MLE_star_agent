=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Failed
Component: Model training implementation
Strategy:  Fix the LightGBM training call by replacing 'verbose_eval' with 'verbose' parameter
Citation:  LightGBM documentation: The correct parameter name for verbosity control is 'verbose' not 'verbose_eval' in newer versions
Reasoning: The error traceback shows a TypeError: train() got an unexpected keyword argument 'verbose_eval'. This indicates a version compatibility issue with LightGBM API. The 'verbose_eval' parameter was deprecated in favor of 'verbose' in newer versions. This is a critical implementation bug preventing any model training from occurring.
