TypeError: train() got an unexpected keyword argument 'early_stopping_rounds'


========================================
=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Failed
Component: LightGBM training implementation
Strategy:  Fix the LightGBM API call by removing 'early_stopping_rounds' parameter and use 'early_stopping' instead, or downgrade to compatible LightGBM version
Citation:  LightGBM documentation (https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io) shows that 'early_stopping_rounds' was deprecated in favor of 'early_stopping' parameter in newer versions
Reasoning: The TypeError indicates an API compatibility issue where 'early_stopping_rounds' is not recognized. This is a fundamental implementation error preventing any model training. The pipeline cannot proceed until this basic function call is corrected. The error suggests either using an outdated LightGBM version that doesn't support this parameter or a version mismatch where the parameter name changed.
