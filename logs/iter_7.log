=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: Ensemble Strategy
Strategy:  Replace the current weighted average ensemble with a stacking ensemble that uses a meta-model (e.g., linear regression) to combine LightGBM and XGBoost predictions, and include a broader set of base models such as CatBoost or Random Forest.
Citation:  Kaggle Rossmann winner solutions frequently employ sophisticated stacking ensembles. The 3rd place solution (arXiv:2506.15692) specifically notes that 'stacking generally outperforms simple averaging' and used multiple base models with a linear meta-learner.
Reasoning: The execution log shows the individual XGBoost model achieved MAPE=18.81, significantly better than the weighted ensemble's MAPE=21.01. This indicates the current ensemble method is degrading performance rather than improving it. A stacking ensemble can learn optimal combinations of model predictions and potentially capture complementary strengths of different algorithms.
