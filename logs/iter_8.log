=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: Feature Engineering
Strategy:  Add comprehensive calendar features including public holidays, school holidays, and their interactions with store-specific characteristics. Also implement a log-transform of the target variable (Sales) to handle scale differences and reduce the impact of outliers.
Citation:  Google ML Sales Forecasting Agent (arxiv:2506.15692) emphasizes the importance of rich temporal features and target transformations for robust forecasting. The winning Rossmann solution on Kaggle extensively used calendar features and log-transformed sales.
Reasoning: The current pipeline achieves consistent MAPE around 9.79% but shows no improvement. The execution log indicates the model is reaching early stopping quickly (206 iterations), suggesting limited feature complexity. Adding calendar features like holiday indicators and their store-specific effects, combined with log-transforming sales to normalize the target distribution, should provide more informative signals for the model to learn complex temporal patterns beyond basic seasonality.
