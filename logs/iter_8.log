=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: Model Ensemble Strategy
Strategy:  Implement a weighted ensemble where the weights are optimized on a validation set, giving higher weight to XGBoost (MAPE: 18.81) and the current stacking ensemble, while reducing reliance on weaker models like CatBoost and Random Forest.
Citation:  Kaggle Rossmann winner solutions frequently use sophisticated ensemble techniques. The 3rd place solution (arXiv:2506.15692, Section 4.3) emphasizes that 'model stacking and blending with careful validation is crucial for maximizing performance'.
Reasoning: The current pipeline shows XGBoost performing significantly better (18.81 MAPE) than other base models, yet the final ensemble MAPE (16.34) suggests the stacking method isn't fully leveraging this strength. A weighted ensemble optimized on validation data could better capitalize on XGBoost's strong performance while mitigating the impact of weaker models (CatBoost: 26.36, Random Forest: 28.67).
