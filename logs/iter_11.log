=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: feature engineering
Strategy:  Add more comprehensive calendar features including public holiday indicators, school holiday periods, and promotional event flags based on the Rossmann store data structure
Citation:  Kaggle Rossmann winner solutions emphasized extensive feature engineering including store-specific holiday effects, promotional calendars, and temporal patterns (e.g., https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/discussion/18024)
Reasoning: The current pipeline shows inconsistent results with many failures and limited improvement in MAPE. The successful iterations achieved ~9.79% MAPE but recent attempts are regressing. Rossmann sales are highly influenced by holidays, school vacations, and promotions. The execution log shows the model trains quickly (56 rounds) suggesting underutilized feature potential. Enhanced calendar features can better capture these seasonal patterns and improve model robustness.
