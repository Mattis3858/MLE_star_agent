=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Success
Component: feature engineering
Strategy:  Add more comprehensive calendar features including holiday effects, school vacation patterns, and promotional calendar interactions
Citation:  Google ML Sales Forecasting Agent (arxiv:2506.15692) emphasizes the importance of rich temporal features including holiday effects and promotional patterns for retail sales forecasting
Reasoning: The current pipeline shows stacking_ensemble achieving the best MAPE (16.3413), but individual models like catboost (26.36) and random_forest (28.67) perform poorly, suggesting inadequate feature representation. The Rossmann dataset contains important calendar effects that aren't being fully utilized. Adding features like: distance to next holiday, holiday type indicators, school vacation flags, and interactions between promotions and calendar events could significantly improve model performance by capturing the underlying sales patterns more effectively.
