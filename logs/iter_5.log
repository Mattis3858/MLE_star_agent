=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Failed
Component: Model training implementation
Strategy:  Fix the LightGBM training call by removing the 'verbose' parameter and using the correct parameter names according to LightGBM's current API
Citation:  LightGBM documentation (https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pythonapi/lightgbm.train.html) shows that 'verbose' is not a direct parameter but should be controlled through 'verbosity' parameter in the params dictionary
Reasoning: The error 'TypeError: train() got an unexpected keyword argument 'verbose'' indicates an API compatibility issue. LightGBM's train function doesn't accept 'verbose' as a direct argument. Instead, verbosity should be set in the params dictionary. This is a fundamental implementation error that prevents any model from being trained, explaining why all iterations have failed with MAPE=inf.
