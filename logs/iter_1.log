AttributeError: 'DatetimeProperties' object has no attribute 'dayof_year'. Did you mean: 'day_of_year'?


========================================
=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Failed
Component: feature engineering
Strategy:  Fix the datetime feature extraction by using the correct pandas attribute 'day_of_year' instead of 'dayof_year'
Citation:  Pandas documentation for datetime properties: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeProperties.day_of_year.html
Reasoning: The pipeline failed due to an AttributeError where 'dayof_year' is not a valid attribute. The correct pandas attribute for extracting day of year from datetime objects is 'day_of_year'. This is a fundamental bug in feature engineering that prevents any model training from starting.
