========================================
=== [Planner Agent] Refinement Strategy ===
========================================
Status:    Failed
Component: model training implementation
Strategy:  Replace the problematic GPU detection code with a simpler, more reliable approach using `torch.cuda.is_available()` or remove GPU dependency entirely for initial testing
Citation:  LightGBM documentation indicates `get_device_name` is not a standard function - basic CPU implementation should be used first to establish baseline functionality
Reasoning: The error occurs because `lgb.get_device_name(0)` is not a valid LightGBM function. This suggests the code was incorrectly adapted from PyTorch or another framework. The immediate fix should focus on making the training run successfully with basic CPU configuration before optimizing for GPU acceleration.
